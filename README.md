##  ChessDB Application

This project implements **ChessDB**, a relational database system for managing chess tournaments compliant with FIDE standards.
This implementation features a working database application with role-based access for players, coaches, arbiters, and database managers.
The system enforces complex domain constraints through MySQL triggers and stored procedures, supporting key operations like match scheduling, player assignment, and ELO rating submission.
